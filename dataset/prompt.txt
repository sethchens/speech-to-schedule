Generate another 25 natural language requests that are different from your previous sample for scheduling events, and their corresponding structured outputs in the format: {title: , des: , date: , time: }.    The date is based on the day you recieve prompt, for example, today is 3/22/2025(Saturday), if the input mention Sunday, then date should be 2/23/2025 in the format mm/dd/yyyy.    Time is as provided in the request and in the format 00:00 AM or 00:00 PM. If no time is mentioned, time is "whole day".    Reminder should only contains details like things to remember, things to bring, things to do... If nothing to put in reminder or the request is ambiguous, reminder is "blank". Location is the lcoation mentioined in the request, if none, location is "blank".    Name, event type, time expression (for example, in 2 hourse, in two hours...), and location should be widely diversed.   
your resopnse would be in json format:    {input: ,    output: {title: , reminder: , lcation: , date: , time: }    }    so you don't need to label them(for example: Example 1, Example 2...)
