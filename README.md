# Overview
The projective of this project is to fine-tune a custom model that can later be used as the fundation of speech-to-schedule feature in the other Kotlin APP.
Another goal is alos to have a deeper understanding of model arcitecture and logic.

To see the result from the model, navigate to api_server_flask folder and run the python file in it. (You are free to modify "input" variable to any sentence in a way you'd use when speaking to phone to put the schedule on.)
